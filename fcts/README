This directory contains the FlatZinc conformance test suite (FCTS).
It currently contains:

    parsing/         - tests for FlatZinc parsers	
    builtins/        - tests for all the FlatZinc built-ins
    output/          - tests for FlatZinc output
    search/          - tests for the standard search annotations

Expected outputs for the tests are contained in files with a *.exp[0-9]*
extension.  The expected outputs in the builtins and search directories
correspond to the case where we are searching for all solutions.  (An
exception to this is the .lp.exp[0-9]* files which contain a single
solution -- these correspond to the output from a MIP solver.)

If no search annotation is provided the solutions may occur in
any order.  There may also be duplicate solutions.


RUNNING THE TESTS
-----------------

The test suite can be running using the ``run-tests'' script contained in
the scripts directory.  This script was designed for use with G12's
FlatZinc implementation so it may require some adaptation if you choose to
use it.

NOTE: the run-tests script makes use of the .opt files.  These files
currently contain command line options specific to G12's FlatZinc
implementation.  If these conflict with your implementation you should
delete them.


FLATZINC BUILT-IN REDEFINITIONS
-------------------------------

Because redefinition occurs at the MiniZinc level (during flattening)
it is not possible to run those tests in the suite that use built-ins
defined via redefinition.


TODO
----

* add a suite of tests covering valid and invalid syntax.
* add a suite of tests covering warnings that the are required by
  the specification.
* add suites of tests specific to particular types of solver: SAT, FD,
  FD set, MIP, IC etc.
* Provide a method of canonicalising all-solutions output where we don't
  care about the order of the solutions (this should also remove duplicate
  solutions).
* Provide a more implementation agnostic way of running the tests.
