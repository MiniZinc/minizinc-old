This directory contains tests for all of FlatZinc's built-in operations.
They are split into five subdirectories:

        bool    - built-in operations on bools.
        int     - built-in operations on ints.
        float   - built-in operations on floats.
        set     - built-in operations on sets.
        array   - built-in operations on arrays.

Each test case exercises a single built-in operation.  The file containing
the test case is the name of that built-in operation (plus the usual .fzn
extension).  Where necessary subsequent tests of a built-in operation are
placed in files named according to the following scheme:

        <built-in op name>_<n>.fzn

where <n> is the next available positive integer (beginning with 2).
